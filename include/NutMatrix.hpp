 * @brief Computes the nutation matrix from mean to true equator and equinox.
 *
 * Constructs the transformation matrix that accounts for the effects of nutation, 
 * converting coordinates from the mean equator and equinox of date to the true 
 * equator and equinox. This transformation is essential for high-precision 
 * astronomical calculations, as it includes periodic variations caused by the 
 * gravitational influence of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge.
