 * @brief Performs the Gibbs method of orbit determination to compute velocity.
 * 
 * This function implements the Gibbs method to determine the velocity vector 
 * at the middle of three given position vectors in space. It uses vector 
 * operations to check coplanarity and consistency of the orbit and returns 
 * the computed velocity along with angles between vectors and an error status.
