 * Defines the transformation from the Earth-centered, Earth-fixed (ECEF) 
 * reference frame aligned with the Greenwich meridian, to a local East-North-Up 
 * coordinate system centered at a given geodetic longitude and latitude. 
 * This rotation is essential for converting global positions into local horizon-based
 * observations, typically used in ground-based tracking and geolocation.
